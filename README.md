# SNGCSV
A little js thing to turn [Soundation](https://soundation.com/) .sng files into [midicsv](https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/) .csv files

**Problems**

It sort of breaks when two of the same notes are played on the same track and one starts after and ends before the other one.

It does not do effects, filters or instruments... yet (no i probably won't do anything with this)
